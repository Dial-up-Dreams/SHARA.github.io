    text-align: center; background-color: rgba(65, 62, 65, 0.824) ;">
         Will Wood, William Sunshine, William Woodism, my dearest favourite artist! He does have 1 pretty major scandal in his career, but I like to believe he has changed as a person.
         Maybe it might be becasue he had been on narcotics whilst making music at the same time for a portion of his life.<br>
         This aspect of him is actually one of the things i find most fascinating about him, because his mental state influences the way he writes his music
         as it does when it comes to every artist and their art, becasue what is art if not a small piece of the artist themselves?

    </p>

        I wouldn't really call this a review of his discography. Will wood's music has been with me for a few years already and I just really like talking about his music

            I had always been listening to indie music what with how brain scratchy and loud thhis album is <br>
            along with the fact that this album is full of mentions of narcotics and being under the influence, i think i felt particularly embarrassed listening to front street when i first found out about the lyrics </p>

                It's hard to explain this unless you're me but 6up 5oh's the song that separates a different section in my will wood playlist<br>
                there was a moment where i'd listen to this song on loop because i loved it so much. The triplet is one of my favourite things in that song,
                and i really love that it's referenced in vampire reference in ICMI.<br>
                I remember playing this song in the car and i think it was a period of time when someone was sick, and i remember feeling awfully guilty the moment the lyrics
                "may death come swiftly and gently to you" playing and feeling really bad about it.<br>
                <br>
                Oh, this is also the song that got me into puttin' on the ritz because i was watching the live where he was playing in someone's backyard
                and he did this really cool transition slow chaotic transition to that song and i really liked it, was a bit disappointed when i listened to the actual song 
                but that's not really the point.

                I didn't know this one was inherently about anorexia until i was playing this in the car, because i remember thinking that my sister
                wouldn't like the loud jarring sound of will wood's other songs and this one was just one of his calmer sounding songs
                and whenever i play music in the car i become Awfully Aware of what the song is about so this leads to me unknowingly listening to a song that is suggestive (shwoopty dwoop) <br>
                anyways, i started paying more attention to the lyrics.. and then realised it was sort of about that. Felt bad about it too because i think my family -- or maybe i was -- suspecting my sister of it idk
